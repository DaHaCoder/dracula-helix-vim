# dracula-helix-vim

One of the most famous color themes for coding is '[dracula](https://draculatheme.com/)'.
Have a look at their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dracula)!

Since the code for the [vim colorscheme](https://github.com/dracula/vim) is written very detailed, I have decided to adopt the code and implement my own colorscheme, which I call 'helix'.

## Redefining the colors

You find the redefined colors in `autoload/dracula.vim`.
